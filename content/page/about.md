single gadget in my hands. 

Currently i have a router with
tomato-wrt working as my personal server, and customized
roms on my Android devices,I also enjoy the music, and have played guitar for 10 years, but
mostly as a casual hobby and not as a professional guitarist.

### Language Learning

* **Spanish**: [I'm Mexican so....]
* **English**: [Good enough for living and working - Cambride FCE B2]
* **Korean**: [Been learning for 2 years, I have a basic level]
* **Japanese**: [This is the half of my first year, so I suck pretty much :P]


# Professional Background

### Development
__Software Engineer__ student with strong Development Abilities.

I am deeply interested on mobile development for **Android**,
Desktop Applications on **.NET**, and web development,
especially in newer and promising technologies like **Nodejs**,
**MongoDB**, **Ruby/Rails**, etc…

I have been playing with programming since Secondary
School, and have tried multiple languages and platforms. So
far liking Javascript/Node.js, C#/.NET and Java/Android the
most.

### Enviroment
I mostly work on **Windows** and recently **OSX** but I can move freely on **Linux** based
environments.

##### School Projects - University of Colima (2012 - 2015)

Even though most school projects sucks, and we all know it, I did multiple
school projects in which I  have practiced all my learnt
knowledge. Some of them are available on my GitHub repo.


#### Information Retrieval Engine (School Project) - University of Korea (March 2016 - June 2016)
I had plenty of fun with this project, it was the first time i had
to work with proper Math models. 

I had to program a Information
Retrieval engine for web documents that calculates similarity
based on a query and displays relevant documents (an
archaic search engine), I did the processing in .NET and
showed the results in a web page made on Express.js/Node.js
with all the information stored in MySQL.
