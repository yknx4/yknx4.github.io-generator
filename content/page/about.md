# Personal Background

### About myself

#### me
Well, I'm Jorge Alejandro Figueroa Perez, sometimes just **Jorge**, sometimes just **Alejandro**, sometimes just **Ale** and in the Internet most of the times I'm **Yknx** (Except on some sites where some asian dude got the nickname first).

I'm a supporter of **Social Freedom**, **Internet Rights** and the **LGBT** Community. I have the opinion that _**everyone can and shall live however the f*ck they want**_ as long as they don't harm anyone else's freedom.

I thing any society should be free of oppresion, and have all their human rights assured regardless of ther political, religious, sexual, or whatever position. 

I think all those rights should be preserved and enforced also in all the modern enviroments that are constantly surging in the Internet. (Yep, This means that you should also be able to whatever you want on the Internet)

And I'm *against Gender Roles* (a byproduct of sexism), I don't think a person can be defined by what society tells them they are supposed to be just because the person was born with or without something between the legs. I consider myself *genderless* or even better *Allgendersatthesametime-ish gender*, so feel free to address me however you feel you should.

I live in this *unique* place called **Colima** in this *interesting*
country called **Mexico**, and I have been living here for about all my life. [Except for the 6 months I gladly had the opportunity to live in **South Korea**]

#### myself
I love to read everything about tech, and I try to hack every
single gadget in my hands. 

Currently I have a router with
tomato-wrt working as my personal server, and customized
roms on my Android devices, I also enjoy the music, and have played guitar for about 10 years, but
mostly as a casual hobby and not as a professional guitarist.

Also I'm a fan of Korean and Japanese culture, I had a University club about it, I had it for about 5 years, so I learnt and researched a lot about it, also I lived 6 months in South Korea and been a few times too Japan. So I got to experience the real thing at least for a short time, and I came to love it even more.

### Language Learning

I love languages, i really like to learn languages, as now I can handle these:

* **Spanish**: [I'm Mexican so....]
* **English**: [Good enough for living and working - Cambride FCE B2]
* **Korean**: [Been learning for 2 years, I have a basic level, 난 한국말을 항상 연습 한 중인데 당신이 연습도 하고 하고 싶으하면 매시지를 보내 주세요]
* **Japanese**: [This is the half of my first year, so I suck pretty much :P]


# Professional Background

### Development
__Software Engineer__ student with strong Development Abilities.

I am deeply interested on mobile development for **Android**,
Desktop Applications on **.NET**, and web development,
especially in newer and promising technologies like **Nodejs**,
**MongoDB**, **Ruby/Rails**, etc…

I have been playing with programming since Secondary
School, and have tried multiple languages and platforms. So
far liking Javascript/Node.js, C#/.NET and Java/Android the
most.

### Enviroment
I mostly work on **Windows** and recently **OSX** but I can move freely on **Linux** based
environments.

Brackets for NodeJS and web development.

MacDown for Markdown.

Android Studio well.... for Android.

Visual Studio for .NET.

RubyMine for Ruby (At least until I have my Student License ㅠㅠ).

Atom and SublimeText are my backups when something else fails.


### Experience
##### MagmaLabs - Intern (2016 - now)

Right now I'm doing my internship as a developer in MagmaLabs, working with Ruby/Rails, Javascript (this time AngularJS) and Android.

Projects:

* Beanstack (Library web application in Ruby/Rails) 
* MagmaRooms (Android Application for Google Calendar)


##### School Projects - University of Colima (2012 - 2015)

Even though most school projects sucks, and we all know it, I did multiple
school projects in which I  have practiced all my learnt
knowledge. Some of them are available on my GitHub repo.


#### Information Retrieval Engine (School Project) - University of Korea (March 2016 - June 2016)
I had plenty of fun with this project, it was the first time i had
to work with proper Math models. 

I had to program a Information
Retrieval engine for web documents that calculates similarity
based on a query and displays relevant documents (an
archaic search engine), I did the processing in .NET and
showed the results in a web page made on Express.js/Node.js
with all the information stored in MySQL.
