### About this blog
So this is the first post, and as every programmer's first time. It has to start with a Hello World!

I'm not a professional blogger nor a writer nor a native english speaker. Expect some idle days, expect some _unproffesional_ posts, and expect lots and lots of silly english mistakes.

### Who am i?
Look the [about]({{< relref "page/about.md" >}}) section.

### What is this and what this is _NOT_ about

<!--more-->

This may become a technology blog, this will include for sure some development posts. But after all, this is a Personal blog.

So I may post about my life, my ideas, my opinions, my personal thoughts and my controverted stance on some already controverted topics.

Feel free to comment everything (as soon as i enable comments), I'm open to hear other's opinion.

And well.... welcome to this place.
