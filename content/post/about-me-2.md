### It started

Everything started before I understood what was going on. I never fitted in, **something always felt wrong** and I was sure that there was something missing.

That started as soon as I started to know myself when I was about 5 years old. Even though I was nerdy/geekish and I always looked forward to video games, computers, etc. When it came to toys and clothes,*I always wanted the ones that wasn't supposed to be for boys*.

### I was...

I was told at a really early age all that stuff was not for me, in a very mean way. So I never asked for it, but I craved for it. I think that's why I never liked to get clothes as present, in comparison to now.

But as I grew older, I knew I was different, I knew what I wanted and it was afflicting me. *You don't know how much it can hurt you to feel you can't be yourself*.

***Until I couldn't stand it anymore.***

That day, drown in tears. I came out to the first person ever, a really close friend. I told her how I felt and what I wanted. I was scared, I thought she may think I was a weirdo, or a pervert. But she was supportive and for the first time I felt I could express myself the way I really wanted to. The same day I asked her to help me to get my very first clothes. *Feminine clothes*.*Clothes that fitted my taste, **that I always wanted to use***.

At that point I wasn't sure about me, to be honest I'm not even that sure now, but I knew I liked girls (feminine guys worked for me too) and I didn't mind having a kinky friend between my legs. But at the same time *I wanted to look like a girl* and behave like one (at least most of the time).

### I am...

This day I know *I'm a transgender*, bigender to be more precise. And to this day I also know I'm not wrong, thanks to all my close friends that have smothered me the way I am and to my lovely girlfriend that is with me in all this. Thanks to them I also know that I can be loved the same way as a any other person and I should be treated the same way too. (if you are against LGBT, this is when you can unfriend me)

I hope people here understand, I hope some day people all around the world will understand.

And I want you all to know this is the real me, because I don't feel like hiding it anymore.

It'll be a long way, and I'll take baby steps. But I don't want to hide, Not anymore.

Feel free to ask me anything.
