# women developers done wrong...

Don't take me wrong, seeking for more women in the technology world is a legit purpose and I support it.

After all **[92](http://fusion.net/story/115998/survey-says-92-percent-of-software-developers-are-men/)% of the developers are men**, and that's a huge gap that makes things unfair sometimes.

 But current movements are doing it wrong, sooo wrong.

All the activities that looks forward to bring more women to the developer side are like this:
<!--more-->

* Come to the Ultrasuperduper development fair only for women

* Join us at the girls only programmer's day

* Welcome to the women's only developer community

* Etc...

**They're fighting a gender polarized environment with....  Another gender polarized environment ?**

They want to pursue a equitable environment where there's an equal number of men and women by making women only groups.  Doesn't that sounds ridiculous?

So, I think they're taking the wrong approach.

I'll take nightclubs as example. They don't look for the same legit purpose but have the same objective: have more women.

_Usually there are more men than women_ in nightclubs. Why? I don't care, but that's a fact.

Nightclub owners needs to have a partner for every guy in the party, so they don't get bored and obviously to consume more drinks.

But if there more men than women looking for nightclubs, **they need to look for strategies to get more women inside**. And I can assure you they will never make a girls only nightclub. That'd be stupid, and **that'd mean wasting half of the possible customers (in our case developers).**

What they do, is to make the place a little more attractive to women. Lowered prices, better seats, no cover, etc... It's not about getting rid of the males so you can get more women, is about lurking women that was not interested with attractive offers that convince them to give it a try.

So back in the topic.

**They should try to make events attractive to women, but not limited to.**

How about a programming course free for woman, but men for a small fee can join too. Or even  better, for a men to join he has to bring two female pals interested in learning about development.

I don't know, there should be a lot of ways of making these events more interesting for women without excluding men. And that's how it has to be done. I think this way this movements can improve a lot.

But after all, this is just my opinion. **In a perfect world, nobody would give a f*ck if you're men or women.**

BTW... I thought about this because recently I saw a lot of interesting development events, but they were limited to women only.
