<h4 id="me:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">me</h4>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m Jorge Alejandro Figueroa Perez, sometimes just <strong>Jorge</strong>, sometimes just <strong>Alejandro</strong>, sometimes just <strong>Ale</strong> and in the Internet most of the times I&rsquo;m <strong>Yknx</strong> (Except on some sites where some asian dude got the nickname first).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a supporter of <strong>Social Freedom</strong>, <strong>Internet Rights</strong> and the <strong>LGBT</strong> Community. I have the opinion that <em><strong>everyone can and shall live however the f*ck they want</strong></em> as long as they don&rsquo;t harm anyone else&rsquo;s freedom.</p>

<p>I think any society should be free of oppresion, and have all their human rights assured regardless of ther political, religious, sexual, or whatever position.</p>

<p>I think all those rights should be also preserved and enforced in all the modern enviroments that are constantly surging in the Internet. (Yep, This means that you should also be able to do whatever you want on the Internet)</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m <em>against Gender Roles</em> (a byproduct of sexism), I don&rsquo;t think a person can be defined by what society tells them they are supposed to be just because the person was born with or without something between the legs. I consider myself <em>genderless</em> or even better <em>Allgendersatthesametime-ish gender</em>, so feel free to address me however you feel you should.</p>

<p>I live in this <em>unique</em> place called <strong>Colima</strong> in this <em>interesting</em>
country called <strong>Mexico</strong>, and I have been living here for about all my life. [Except for the 6 months I gladly had the opportunity to live in <strong>South Korea</strong>]</p>

<h4 id="myself:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">myself</h4>

<p>I love to read everything about tech, and I try to hack every
single gadget in my hands.</p>

<p>Currently I have a router with
tomato-wrt working as my personal server, and customized
roms on my Android devices, I also enjoy the music, and have played guitar for about 10 years, but
mostly as a casual hobby and not as a professional guitarist.</p>

<p>Also I&rsquo;m a fan of Korean and Japanese culture, I had for about 5 years a University club about it, so I learned and researched a lot about it, also I lived 6 months in South Korea and been a few times too Japan. So I got to experience the real thing at least for a short time, and I came to love it even more.</p>

<h3 id="language-learning:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">Language Learning</h3>

<p>I love languages, i really like to learn languages, as now I can handle these:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Spanish</strong>: [I&rsquo;m Mexican so&hellip;.]</li>
<li><strong>English</strong>: [Good enough for living and working - Cambride FCE B2]</li>
<li><strong>Korean</strong>: [Been learning for 2 years, I have a basic level, 난 한국말을 항상 연습 한 중인데 당신이 연습도 하고 하고 싶으하면 매시지를 보내 주세요]</li>
<li><strong>Japanese</strong>: [This is the half of my first year, so I suck pretty much :P]</li>
</ul>

<p>I had plenty of fun with this project, it was the first time i had
to work with proper Math models.</p>

<p>I had to program a Information
Retrieval engine for web documents that calculates similarity
based on a query and displays relevant documents (an
archaic search engine), I did the processing in .NET and
showed the results in a web page made on Express.js/Node.js
with all the information stored in MySQL.</p>
